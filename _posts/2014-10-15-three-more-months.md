As I type this we have just paid our first portion of our agency fees for our adoption. 
We had to do something we really did not want to do, and that was take out a line of credit 
to offset a portion of those upfront expenses. I don’t say this for any other reason than 
to keep our journey to our baby open and honest. We want others to hear our story, and hear 
the amazing things God is doing through this journey.  

So with that said, I’ll tell you all that we have three months to raise about $34,000.00. 
Thirty. Four. Thousand. Dollars. To most people, including us, that VERY large number seems 
VERY scary. However, do we not serve an incredible God? A God that is “able to do far beyond 
all that we could ask or imagine by His power at work within us”(Ephesians 3:20). A God that 
tells us “do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, 
with thanksgiving, present your request to God”(Philippians 4:6). A God that is always with 
us! (Psalms 23:4). How can we ever doubt that God will not come through when He gives us 
promises like these? We have no doubt that God is going to do amazing things in this next 3 
months; we also have no doubt that God is going to do amazing things through our baby boy!  

We are so incredibly thankful for EVERYONE who has helped us out so far, we cannot thank you 
enough for all your sacrifices on our behalf. We feel so blessed to be surrounded by so many 
amazing people who have a heart for adoption and support those who are traveling down the 
adoption road just as we are. If I have said it once, I have said it a 100 times, it takes a 
village and we could not do this without you all and the way God is using each and everyone 
one of you. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  

Because we have so much more to raise and such little time to do it in we will be doing 
several more fund-raisers so that Baby Boy Dallas can come home soon!  

## T-Shirts! T-Shirts! T-Shirts!  
We still have plenty of Adoption T-shirts to sell, so if you haven’t bought yours yet hurry 
up and grab one! They are $20.00 pick-up and $23.00 Shipped. Several people have claimed 
they feel like a hug when you put them on… I truly believe them!  

You can jump on over to our online store and order now!  

## October  
**Garage Sale**  
October 24th and 25th we will be having a garage sale! So many wonderful people have already 
donated items, but we can always use more! So if you need to do a little fall cleaning and 
get some stuff out of your house we would be happy to take it off your hands. Or if you are 
interested in stopping by to see what we have, just come on by. We will also be posting some 
of the larger items online so people know what we have.  

**Pancake and waffle mix fund-raiser!**  
Y’all these pancake mixes are so fun and yummy! Southern Culture is the name of these delicious 
mixes and they are only $8 a mix. Each mix will make about 12 pancakes, they are Non-GMO, made 
with Organic ingredients, and they even have Gluten Free options! We will be placing the final 
order on November 1st so hurry and get your order in!  

## November  
More Pancakes! Just a little different this time.  
We will be doing a pancake breakfast at Burning Bush Baptist Church some time in November, so 
stay tuned for more details and ticket sales.

*Other opportunities to come; please stay tuned*  

We have applied for a handful of adoption specific grants and matching funds and we are praying 
hard that some of those come through. Like I mentioned earlier, we absolutely know God is going 
to make this happen and He will bring the funds we need to bring our baby home! Thank you so much 
for taking the time to read our updates and for walking this journey with us. We love our village! 
< that’s you all ;)  

Zech & Liz
