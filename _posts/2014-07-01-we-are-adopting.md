We are so excited to officially announce that we are adopting! Adoption has been on both our hearts long before we met each other 7 years ago, and we are thrilled that God has opened the doors for us to pursue what He put on our hearts so long ago. 

The saying goes "it takes a village" and we completely agree! We are currently in the process of finishing our home study, which is a crucial piece to being adoption ready. We know God has called us to this journey and we have no doubt that He will provide the funds to bring our baby home! 

The goal we are setting is to cover the cost of the first leg of our adoption, and we would be so incredibly grateful for your support whether itâ€™s financially, through prayer, or just by spreading our story. We truly appreciate YOU for taking the time to read a small portion of our story, you really are amazing!
